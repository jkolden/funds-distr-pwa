This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The application is a PWA that allows for mobile entry of SaaS project time cards. Upon submitting a timecard, the data is saved to an Oracle database and is further processed before being loaded to Oracle SaaS Project Cost Accounting.
